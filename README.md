# Simon-Game
# Welcome to the Simon Game! This is a classic memory game where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. Test your memory and see how far you can go!

It presents players with a series of tunes and button flashes, challenging them to click the buttons in the exact same order and repeat the sequence correctly. As the player succeeds, the series progressively becomes longer and more complex. However, if the player makes a mistake or fails to repeat the sequence correctly, the game is over.

The game provides an interactive and engaging experience for users, testing their memory and concentration skills. By successfully repeating the sequence, players can aim for high scores and challenge themselves to reach further levels of difficulty.
